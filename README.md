# MazeSolver
This program uses pygame to create a maze and uses a Breadth-First Search Algorithm to find the shortest route.

By left clicking on squares on the grid, walls of the maze can be drawn.
By right clicking on squares on the grid, walls of the maze can be removed.

Clicking the space-key locks the maze.

After the maze is locked, the s-key can be pressed to add one more move to all the possible paths.
These paths are drawn on the grid in blue. 

Once the maze has been solved, the shortest path will turn red.
